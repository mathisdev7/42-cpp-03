![Final Score](https://i.ibb.co/fBtNwQS/image.png)

## Project Description
The `CPP Module 03` focuses on inheritance in object-oriented programming. This module introduces base and derived classes, highlighting the importance of proper class hierarchy design and polymorphism in C++.

## Journey
This module was an exciting deep dive into inheritance, allowing me to build more structured and reusable code. I successfully completed it on my first attempt, applying best practices in class hierarchy and polymorphism.

## Key Learnings
- Understanding and implementing class inheritance
- Exploring base and derived class relationships
- Utilizing polymorphism for flexible code design
- Handling constructors and destructors in inheritance chains

## Technical Details
- Created a structured class hierarchy to model real-world relationships.
- Implemented virtual functions to enable polymorphism.
- Ensured proper destructor chaining to manage resources efficiently.

## Project Status
- **First Attempt**: Success
- **Completion Time**: 1 day per module

## Challenges Faced
- Managing proper constructor and destructor calls in inheritance trees.
- Understanding when to use virtual functions effectively.
- Avoiding slicing issues when working with derived classes.

## Reflection
This module emphasized the importance of designing extensible and maintainable class hierarchies. Learning how to apply polymorphism correctly will be invaluable for future projects involving more complex object-oriented architectures.

## Skills Developed
- Class inheritance and hierarchy design
- Proper use of polymorphism and virtual functions
- Resource management in derived classes
- Debugging inheritance-related issues
- Strengthening object-oriented programming principles
